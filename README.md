# JoCoin

JoCoin is an attempt to implement the more interesting parts of Bitcoin
that I've come across in my readings. It's a grey-box reimplementation,
having only read high-level descriptions of what it is and how it works.
For fun bonus points, I also implemented RSA key generation and signatures
from scratch.
