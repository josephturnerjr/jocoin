# TODO

**Or rather, what's undone**

  * Client
    * Check balance for given pubkey
    * Add transaction
  * Active gossip (interruption of mining, locking the chain, etc.)
  * Better CLI for seeding peer list
  * Wrap keys in class for pretty printing etc.
  * Merkle tree of transactions
  * Efficient gossip (don't transmit entire history)
